Theorem strlen_nwc: forall s2 s1, strlen_i386 s1 = strlen_i386 s2.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(* Example #1: Type safety
   We first prove that the program is well-typed (automated by the Picinae_typecheck tactic).
   This is useful for later inferring that all CPU registers and memory contents have
   values of appropriate bitwidth throughout the program's execution. *)
Theorem strlen_welltyped: welltyped_prog x86typctx strlen_i386.
Proof.
  Picinae_typecheck.
Qed.

(* Example #2: Memory safety
   Strcmp contains no memory-writes, and is therefore trivially memory-safe. *)
Theorem strcmp_preserves_memory:
